## 📋 NEXT: Update App Layout

I need to update `src/app/layout.tsx` to wrap your app with the Auth Provider.

**Run this command:**
```bash
git add .
git status
```

Then tell me when you're ready and I'll update the layout file to enable authentication across the entire app.

---

## 🎯 After That's Done

Once the layout is updated and Firebase services are enabled, you'll be able to:

### Test Authentication:
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/login
2. Sign up with Google or Email
3. Get 3 free credits automatically
4. See your credits in the UI

### Test Video Generation with Credits:
1. Build a prompt
2. Generate video
3. Credits automatically deducted
4. Video saved to your account
5. View history in dashboard

## 📊 What You Need To Tell Me

1. **Have you enabled these 3 services?**
   - [ ] Authentication (Google + Email)
   - [ ] Firestore Database
   - [ ] Storage

2. **Ready for me to update the app layout?**
   - This will wrap the app with AuthProvider
   - Enable login/signup throughout the app
   - Protect video generation with authentication

## 💰 Monetization Ready!

Once this is working, we can add:
- ✅ Stripe payment integration
- ✅ Credit packages ($5, $25, $100)
- ✅ Subscription tiers
- ✅ Admin dashboard
- ✅ Usage analytics

**You're 90% of the way to monetization!** 🚀

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you get Firebase errors:
1. Make sure all 3 services are enabled in console
2. Wait 1-2 minutes after enabling
3. Clear browser cache
4. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

**Tell me when Firebase services are enabled and I'll continue!** 🔥
