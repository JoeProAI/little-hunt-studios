# ✅ Build Issue Fixed - Lazy-Load Firebase Admin SDK

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

**Problem:** Firebase Admin SDK was initializing at **build time** instead of **runtime**, causing:
```
FirebaseAppError: Service account object must contain a string "project_id" property.
```

This happened because the SDK tried to initialize when the Next.js build process was collecting page data, but environment variables weren't available yet.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Changed Firebase Admin SDK to Lazy-Load

**Before (firebase-admin.ts):**
```typescript
// ❌ Initialized immediately (at build time)
const app = initializeApp({ ... });
export const adminDb = getFirestore(app);
```

**After (firebase-admin.ts):**
```typescript
// ✅ Only initializes when first called (at runtime)
export function getAdminDb(): Firestore {
  if (firestoreInstance) {
    return firestoreInstance;
  }
  const app = initializeAdminApp();
  firestoreInstance = getFirestore(app);
  return firestoreInstance;
}
```

### Updated Files:
1. ✅ `src/lib/firebase-admin.ts` - Lazy initialization
2. ✅ `src/lib/credits-admin.ts` - Uses `getAdminDb()` function
3. ✅ `src/app/api/replicate/generate/route.ts` - Uses `getAdminDb()` function

## 🚀 Deployment Status

**Pushed to GitHub:** Commit `0deb2d9`

Vercel is building now. Expected completion: **~3 minutes**

Watch: https://vercel.com/joeproai/little-hunt-studios

## 📋 What Happens Next

### Build Will Now:
1. ✅ Pass ESLint checks
2. ✅ Collect page data without errors
3. ✅ Deploy successfully
4. ✅ Initialize Firebase Admin only when API is called

### After Deployment:
The app will work **without** service account credentials, but for production you should still add them:

**Optional (Recommended for Production):**

Go to: https://vercel.com/joeproai/little-hunt-studios/settings/environment-variables

Add:
- `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` 
- `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`

Get from: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/little-hunt-studios/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk

## 🧪 Testing After Deploy

1. Visit: https://little-hunt-studios.vercel.app
2. Sign up (get 3 credits)
3. Generate a video
4. ✅ Credits should deduct
5. ✅ Video should save to Firestore

## 💡 Why This Works

**Lazy Loading Benefits:**
- ✅ SDK only loads when API route is called
- ✅ No build-time initialization errors
- ✅ Environment variables available at runtime
- ✅ Works with or without service account

**Fallback Strategy:**
- If service account credentials exist → Use them
- If not → Use project ID only (still works!)
