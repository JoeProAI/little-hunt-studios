## 🎯 Profitability Strategy

### Why This Works

1. **Usage Patterns are Mixed**
   - Most users will use a mix of tiers
   - Not everyone maxes out credits monthly
   - Many users stay on Pro tier even if they could use Free

2. **Psychology of Pricing**
   - Pro tier at $29 hits sweet spot for creators
   - Studio tier provides clear value for heavy users
   - Credit system encourages "choosing the right tool"

3. **Profit Margins are Healthy**
   - Pro tier: 50-65% margin (excellent for SaaS)
   - Studio tier: 45-65% margin (sustainable & scalable)
   - Free tier: Loss leader for acquisition

4. **Scalability**
   - Higher usage = Better Replicate pricing tiers
   - Infrastructure costs don't scale linearly
   - Support costs manageable with good UX

### Monthly Revenue Projections

**Conservative Estimate (100 paid users):**
- 70 Pro users × $29 = $2,030
- 30 Studio users × $99 = $2,970
- **Total MRR: $5,000**
- Costs (55% of revenue): $2,750
- **Net profit: $2,250/month** ✅

**Growth Scenario (500 paid users):**
- 350 Pro users × $29 = $10,150
- 150 Studio users × $99 = $14,850
- **Total MRR: $25,000**
- Costs (50% of revenue): $12,500
- **Net profit: $12,500/month** ✅✅

**Scale Scenario (2,000 paid users):**
- 1,400 Pro users × $29 = $40,600
- 600 Studio users × $99 = $59,400
- **Total MRR: $100,000**
- Costs (45% with volume discounts): $45,000
- **Net profit: $55,000/month** ✅✅✅
