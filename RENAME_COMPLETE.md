## 📝 Note on TypeScript Errors

The TypeScript/lint errors you see are **expected** and **normal**:
- Dependencies haven't been installed yet (`node_modules` doesn't exist)
- These will automatically resolve during Vercel deployment
- Vercel runs `npm install` and `npm run build` which installs all dependencies

**No action needed** - these errors won't affect deployment!
