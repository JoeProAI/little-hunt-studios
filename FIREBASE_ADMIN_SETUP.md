# 🔧 Firebase Admin SDK Fix Applied

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Problem:** API routes were using client-side Firebase SDK, causing server errors.

**Solution:** Created Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations.

## 📋 Files Created/Updated

1. ✅ `src/lib/firebase-admin.ts` - Admin SDK initialization
2. ✅ `src/lib/credits-admin.ts` - Server-side credit management
3. ✅ `src/app/api/replicate/generate/route.ts` - Updated to use Admin SDK
4. ✅ `package.json` - Added `firebase-admin` package

## 🔐 IMPORTANT: Add Service Account to Vercel

### Option 1: Simple Setup (For Testing)

The app will work with just the existing Firebase config, but for production you need:

Go to Vercel and add these **3 additional variables**:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID (already added)
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY
```

### How to Get Service Account Credentials:

1. **Go to Firebase Console:**
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/little-hunt-studios/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk

2. **Generate New Private Key:**
   - Click "Generate new private key"
   - Click "Generate key"
   - Download JSON file

3. **Extract Values from JSON:**
   
   Open the downloaded JSON file and find:
   
   ```json
   {
     "project_id": "little-hunt-studios",
     "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
     "client_email": "firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@little-hunt-studios.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
   }
   ```

4. **Add to Vercel:**
   
   **FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL:**
   ```
   firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@little-hunt-studios.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   ```
   
   **FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY:**
   ```
   -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
   ... (entire key with \n characters)
   -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
   ```
